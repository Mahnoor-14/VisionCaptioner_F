**VisionCaptioner** is an AI-powered image captioning system that combines **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and **Transformers** to automatically generate human-like captions for images.  

It provides a web interface where users can upload images and get meaningful captions in real-time. This project is designed for educational, accessibility, and research purposes.

---

## 🔹 Tech Stack

- **Frameworks**: PyTorch / TensorFlow  
- **Modeling**: ResNet-50 (CNN) + Transformer Decoder or LSTM with attention

## 🔹 Project Workflow

1. **Image Feature Extraction**  
   - Use ResNet-50 to extract high-level visual features from images.  

2. **Caption Generation**  
   - Use a Transformer or LSTM decoder to generate captions trained on COCO dataset.  

3. **Training**  
   - Train end-to-end using cross-entropy loss with teacher forcing.  
   - Fine-tune CNN layers optionally after initial convergence.  

4. **Inference**  
   - Generate captions using greedy decoding or beam search.  

5. **Web Interface**  
   - User uploads an image → CNN extracts features → Decoder generates caption → Caption displayed on screen.
